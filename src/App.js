That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard Tournament', a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire.

Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.",
